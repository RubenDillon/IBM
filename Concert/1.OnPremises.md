On Premises Deployment
=

In this document we will discuss how to deploy Concert on Premises. We will be using one of the deployment models and the easiest way to do that.

For this activity we will need a virtual machine with the following reqs

- 16 vCPU
- 32 GB RAM
- at least 512 GB vDisk
- Linux Operating System (we will be using RHEL 9.2)

xxxy

Prepare the environment
-

1. Validate that the machine have at least free 512 GB, if it not do the following steps to extend your partition ...

If your are using LVM...

```
sudo su

yum install lvm2

df -h

vgdisplay

vgextend sysvg /dev/vdc

vgdisplay

lvextend -l +100%FREEÂ  /dev/mapper/sysvg-lv_var

xfs_growfs /dev/mapper/sysvg-lv_var

df -h

```

If you are not using LVM... and you have for example /dev/vda with devices where /dev/vda4 is "/" and /dev/vdd is another disk (500 GB vDisk)


```
df -h

lsblk

sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/vdd

sudo mkdir /mnt/tempvar

sudo mount /dev/vdd /mnt/tempvar

sudo rsync -avx /var/ /mnt/tempvar/

sudo mv /var /var.backup
sudo mkdir /var

sudo mount /dev/vdd /var

ls /var

sudo blkid /dev/vdd
# (copy the UUID)

sudo nano /etc/fstab
# Add at the end:
# UUID=UUID-HERE   /var   xfs   defaults   0 0

sudo umount /var
sudo mount -a
df -h

sudo rm -rf /var.backup

```

   
3. configure the VM to support podman (Podman currently is the prefered container for RHEL OS)


4. Install git client and validate that wget is available   



Concert pre reqs

```
 
2. Expand the ibm-concert-std.tgz package in the chosen directory with at least 512 GB of available disk space. Replace <install_directory> with the local file path.

```
cd <install_directory> 
tar xfz ibm-concert-std.tgz
```

3. Setup environment variables

```
export DOCKER_EXE=podman
export CONCERT_REGISTRY=cp.icr.io/cp/concert

```

4. Set the username of the container registry
