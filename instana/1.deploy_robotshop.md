# Robotshop deployment in a Linux virtual machine

In this tutorial we will be configuring an application using docker in a linux virtual machine

We define the following scenario
- We have a linux virtual machine (in our case a RHEL 8)
- We already have a INSTANA tenant

Configure the virtual machine
=

1. Connect the virtual machine using ssh. In our example we have a SSH KEY

       ssh -i pem_ibmcloudvsi_download.pem 169.55.98.38 -p 2223 -l itzuser
   
2. Install the yum-utils package (which provides the yum-config-manager utility) and set up the repository

        sudo yum install -y yum-utils
        sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/rhel/docker-ce.repo

   
3. Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose:

        sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
   
4. Start docker

        sudo systemctl start docker

5. test docker

       sudo docker run hello-world

6. Deploy git in the virtual machine

       sudo yum install git

7. Clone the repository to the virtual machine

       git clone https://github.com/instana/robot-shop.git

8. Deploy the application

       sudo docker compose pull

9. Run the application

       sudo docker compose up

10 Open another ssh to the virtual machine and give load to the application using the following

       sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose-load.yaml up

11 Then open Instana, go to Settings -> Agents. Then select Install Agents button and finally select the Linux Automatic Installation (One liner)

12 From Step 1 use the defaults (Dynamic, Azul Zulu 1.8 and Interactive) and in the Step 2 select "Install and start as service". Copy the line and execute in the virtual machine
    
13 You could check the status of the agent in the virtual machine and using the Instana UI

       sudo systemctl status instana-agent.service
       
14. Using the Instana UI, you could go to Settings -> Agents and review the Agent Details (you could see the icon with the magnifying glass to select your virtual machine)

15. If you want to add more load to the application and introduce an error in Payment you could modify the load-gen.sh file from the folder loadgen. You need to do the following changes, at least

       - NUM_CLIENTS=100                                    ---- this is line 7
       - RUNTIME=1h                                         ---- this is line 10
       - ERROR=1                                            ---- this is line 16
       - name loadgen2                                      ---- this is line 97
   
16 Then you could run the loader using the following command

     sudo ./load-gen.sh
