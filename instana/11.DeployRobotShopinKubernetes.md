Deploying Robot Shop application in Kubernetes
=

1 We will be using K3s to deploy Robot Shop in this example. If you dont have already deployed a K3s, please review the information in the current github.

2 Once you have K3s, Instana Agent and Kubectl command cli deployed, review if you have the github cli deployed. If it not, continue with the following step

    sudo yum install git

3 Then clone the Robot-Shop git

    git clone https://github.com/instana/robot-shop.git

4 Change the default storageclass in K3s

    kubectl get storageclass local-path  -o yaml > storageclass.yaml

5 Edit the file storageclass.yaml and change the name of the storage class to standard


6 Apply the new class and change the default class in the K3s

    kubectl apply -f storageclass.yaml

    kubectl patch storageclass local-path -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"false"}}}'

    kubectl get storageclass
    

7 Move to the Robot-Shop folder for K8s, move to the helm folder, create the ns robot-shop and then run the helm to deploy it
      
     kubectl create ns robot-shop
     helm install robot-shop --namespace robot-shop .

8 To review where the app is published run the following command

    kubectl get svc -n robot-shop
    
9 You will found a service called "web" that have a External-IP address. Use that with http and port 8080 to access it, as follows

    http://169.62.110.155:8080

10 To give load the solution, open the load-deployment.yaml and change the URL to contact the solution
