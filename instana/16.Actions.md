# Use of Actions in Instana

In this tutorial we will be configuring Instana Actions 

We define the following scenario
- We have a linux virtual machine (in our case a RHEL 9)
- We already have a INSTANA tenant
- We already have Robot-Shop deployed

Situation:
We have some strange behaviour in our application. The strange behaviour is simulated when we drop a MySQL docker in the application.
In Instana will we create a Smart Alert that pay attention in Erroneous Calls, will create an Action (restart all the containers) and a Policy associated to the Smart Alert.

We want to Instana detect the problem, create Incident, give us information about the root cause and apply the policy associated to this problem.


Create the Smart Alert from a Robot-SHop Perspective
=

1. Create the Smart Alert using the Wizar for Erroneous Calls

Create the Action and the Policy
=

1. Create the Action from the Automation menu

 2. Create the Policy in the Automation menu

Configure the Action in the Instana Sensor
=
 1. Connect to the Virtual Machine where Robot-shop runs and create the Insta user 

    sudo su

    useradd insta

    passwd insta
    usermod -aG wheel insta
    usermod -aG docker insta

    su - insta

    git clone https://github.com/instana/robot-shop.git

2. Sarch for the mySQL container

    docker container list
    docker container stop xxxx (where xxxx is the mysql container)

 3. Review the Robot-Shop Perspective and wait to start to h



 Force the error in the application
 =

 1. Connect to the Virtual Machine where Robot-shop runs and execute the following commands

    docker container list

    docker container stop xxxx (where xxxx is the mysql container)

 2. Review the Robot-Shop Perspective and wait to start to have Erroneous Calls
