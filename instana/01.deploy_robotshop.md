# Robotshop deployment in a Linux virtual machine

In this tutorial we will be configuring an application using docker in a linux virtual machine

We define the following scenario
- We have a linux virtual machine (in our case a RHEL 8)
- We already have a INSTANA tenant

Configure the virtual machine
=

1. Connect the virtual machine using ssh. In our example we have a SSH KEY

       chmod 400 pem_ibmcloudvsi_download.pem
       ssh -i pem_ibmcloudvsi_download.pem 169.55.98.38 -p 2223 -l itzuser

2. If you need to register your virtual machine

          sudo rhc connect --username user --password cccccc

3. (Optional). If you want to change the name of the host, you could rename it with the following command

       hostnamectl set-hostname new-client-name.example.com

To review the name of the current FQDN

       hostname       
   
4. Install the yum-utils package (which provides the yum-config-manager utility) and set up the repository

        sudo su
        yum install -y yum-utils
        yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/rhel/docker-ce.repo

   
5. Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose:

        sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
   
6. Start docker

        sudo systemctl start docker

7. test docker

       sudo docker run hello-world

8. Deploy git in the virtual machine

       sudo yum install git

9. Clone the repository to the virtual machine

       git clone https://github.com/instana/robot-shop.git

Deploy the Robot Shop application
=

1. Pull or build the application. If you want to build, continue with the following step. If you want to pull ... use the following command and continue in step 3

       cd robot-shop
       sudo docker compose pull

3. Run the application

       export INSTANA_AGENT_KEY="xxxx"

       sudo docker compose up -d
   
4. You could use the recommendation to access the application (read below) or use the load generator

5. To use a load generator

          cd load-gen
          ./load-gen.sh


Deploy the Instana Agent in the virtual machine
=

1. Then open Instana, go to Settings -> Agents. Then select Install Agents button and finally select the Linux Automatic Installation (One liner)

2. From Step 1 use the defaults (Dynamic, Azul Zulu 1.8 and Interactive) and in the Step 2 select "Install and start as service". Copy the line and execute in the virtual machine
    
3. You could check the status of the agent in the virtual machine and using the Instana UI

       sudo systemctl status instana-agent.service
       
4. Using the Instana UI, you could go to Settings -> Agents and review the Agent Details (you could see the icon with the magnifying glass to select your virtual machine)


Change the behaviour of the application
=

1. If you want to add more load to the application and introduce an error in Payment you could modify the load-gen.sh file from the folder loadgen. You need to do the following changes, at least

       - NUM_CLIENTS=100                                    ---- this is line 7
       - RUNTIME=1h                                         ---- this is line 10
       - ERROR=1                                            ---- this is line 16
       - name loadgen2                                      ---- this is line 97
   
2. Then you could run the loader using the following command

     sudo ./load-gen.sh 


Create a Zone for the Virtual Machine
=

1. If you want to put your virtual machine in a particular zone, we could edit the file configuration.yaml in /opt/instana/agent/etc/instana and modify the file to have something like the following

       # Hardware & Zone
       com.instana.plugin.generic.hardware:
         enabled: true # disabled by default
         availability-zone: 'Demo'

 2. Saving the file, we need to wait a couple of minutes and the Infrastructure dashboard will show the VM in a zone called DEMO


Access the application
=

1. To access the application, we need to disable the firewall or to enable the access to port 8080. For testing, we will disable the firewall of the VM

   systemctl disable firewalld

2. Then using a browser use the public IP of the VM and the port 8080

   http://x.x.x.x:8080


Troubleshooting Robot-Shop App
=

If the application dont show connections between the components, restart docker service and start again the application

       systemctl stop docker
       systemctl stop docker.service
       systemctl start docker
       docker compose up -d

in another terminal

       cd load-gen
       ./load-gen.sh


If you want remove everything (images, docker, etc...)

       docker rmi $(docker images -q)

       docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

       docker container list

       docker image ls

       

(Optional) - Deploy Quote of the day application
=
This is a very simple application to test it

https://gitlab.com/quote-of-the-day/quote-of-the-day/-/tree/master

(Optional) - Deploy Mealie 
=
This is a Self Hosted Recipe Manager

https://hub.docker.com/r/hkotel/mealie

Follow the next steps

       git clone https://github.com/hay-kot/mealie.git  or clone from https://github.com/RubenDillon/mealie

       cd mealie

       change the port to 8080 if your are using another VM  ( use the example from github/RubenDillon/IBM/instana/AppB.docker-compose.yml )

       docker compose up -d

       http://dockerIP:8080
       
If you want to import recipes ... you could try for example.. the following recipes

       - https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/269004/one-pot-spaghetti-with-meat-sauce/
       - https://cookpad.com/ar/recetas/22549658-paleta-a-la-cacerola?ref=inspiration_feed

You need to modify and add code to the Python environment to be discovered and used by INSTANA

       docker container list   (you will discover where MEALIE is running and which command invoques the app... in this case /app/run.sh)
       docker exec -it xxxy bash
       apt-get update
       apt-get install vim
       vim /app/run.sh

       add the following lines

       export AUTOWRAPT_BOOTSTRAP=instana
       export INSTANA_AGENT_HOST="127.0.0.1"
       export INSTANA_AGENT_PORT="42699"

exit from the container and then restart it

       docker container restart xxxy

Then you need to update the instana agent deployment

       docker exec -it xxxy bash
       pip install gitpython
       pip install -U instana

exit from the container and then restart it

       docker container restart xxxy

Then need to restart the Instana agent associated to this virtual machine

Now.. you will see the python application and you could start to receive information from the application


(Optional) - Deploy Budget Zero 
=
Budgetzero is a free, open-source, privacy-friendly, offline-first budgeting system. 

https://hub.docker.com/r/budgetzero/budgetzero

(Optional) - Deploy FireFly III 
=
"Firefly III" is a (self-hosted) manager for your personal finances. It can help you keep track of your expenses and income, so you can spend less and save more. Firefly III supports the use of budgets, categories and tags. It can import data from external sources and it has many neat financial reports available.

https://hub.docker.com/r/fireflyiii/core

Follow the next steps

       Create three files that are mentioned in https://docs.firefly-iii.org/how-to/firefly-iii/installation/docker/

       Basically you need to download 
              docker-compose.yml
              .env
              .db.env

       Then you need to run the following command

              docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --pull=always

       Then you could access the application using http://dockerIP

       
If you want more information about the MariaDB, you need to add the following in the configuration.yml from /opt/instana/agent/etc/instana
