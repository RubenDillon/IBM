# Introduce a problem in the Robotshop application

In this tutorial we will introduce a problem in the Robotshop application

We define the following scenario
- We have a linux virtual machine (in our case a RHEL 8)
- We already have a INSTANA tenant
- We already deploy Instana Agent
- We already deploy the Robotshop Application
- We already create an Application perspective

Introduce the problem in the application
=

1. Connect to the virtual machine using ssh. In our example we have a SSH KEY

       ssh -i pem_ibmcloudvsi_download.pem 169.55.98.38 -p 2223 -l itzuser
   
2. Execute the following command to found in which container is deployed the MySQL database

        sudo docker container list

3. Suppose that MySQL is running in the container e40ba7c8ce0b Now run the following command to stop de container

        sudo docker container kill e40ba7c8ce0b
   
4. Now wait a couple of seconds and go to the Instana UI -> Applications and select the Application perspective of the application. Now you will start to see Erroneous Calls and a new EVENT

5. If you want to have the app in the normal behaviour, you could restart the mysql or run the following command

       sudo docker compose up -d
