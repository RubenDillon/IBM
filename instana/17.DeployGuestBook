# Deploy GuestBook 

1. To deploy GuestBook in K3s you need to download six yamls files that are in the present folder

         frontend-svc.yaml
         frontend.yaml
         redis-follower-svc.yaml
         redis-follower.yaml
         redis-leader-svc.yaml
         redis-leader.yaml

2. Those files are for a Kustomization, to use it for a simple app deployment.

       kubectl apply -k ./
   
3. Execute the following command and review were the service is deployed (take note about the External-IP Address)

      kubectl get svc wordpress

4. Use a web browser to access the WordPress (using 150.239.48.11 as an external-IP example)

      http://150.239.48.11:8080
