# Client view - Website monitoring

Website monitoring, often called End-User Monitoring (EUM), or Real-User Monitoring (RUM), is an important tool to understand digital user experience.

Instana supports website monitoring by analyzing actual browser request times and route loading times. It allows detailed insights into the web browsing experience of users, and deep visibility into application call paths.

The Instana website monitoring solution works by using a lightweight JavaScript agent, which is embedded into the monitored website. To install the JavaScript agent, access the Websites section in the Instana UI to start tracking website performance data. The Instana UI guides you through the installation process.
